# Project2

# Description

This project describes a maze solver in Prolog using 'find_exit/2', where there is recognition of symbols for start, exit, wall, and floor. It also finds a valid list of directions based on known variables and using Depth-First Search.

predicate.pl --> implementation of main predicate 'find_exit/2'
example.pl --> example file that defines 'basic_map/1'
test.pl --> file that generates and portrays random mazes with 'gen_map/4' and 'display_map/1'
devlog.md --> my devlog that has my entries and thoughts while coding
README.md --> overall description of project

Compile/Running:

- Open SWI-Prolog application
- open folder and files in associated directory
