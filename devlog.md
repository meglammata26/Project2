What I know:
I read the project description. I need to create a predicate that goes from a start space to an exit space. It should work even if an unbound variable is called and should fail if the maze is invalid.

Overall Plan:
Create my repo. Add this devlog. Add relevant code files. For my first step, I will create a predicate that will recognize each of the cell values and directions.
