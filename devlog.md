What I know:
I read the project description. I need to create a predicate that goes from a start space to an exit space. It should work even if an unbound variable is called and should fail if the maze is invalid.

Overall Plan:
Create my repo. Add this devlog. Add relevant code files. For my first step, I will create a predicate that will recognize each of the cell values and directions.

Thoughts:
Added the recognition of the cell values and directions.

Goals/Plan:
Need to implement a way to validate coordinates. Simulate list of actions. Begin implementation of DFS for when the value is unbound

Thoughts:
Had to correct some syntax issues in my code. Code is running properly for validating coordinations and simulation of actions.
Goals/Plan:
Next I need to finish the predicate logic and start the implementation of DFS for when the value is unbound
